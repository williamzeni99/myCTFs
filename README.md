This repo contains all the CTF resolved by me during the 'Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity' and 'Computer Security' courses in the year 2023/2024 at my university Politecnico di Miano 

I tried to comment each challenge and I'm sorry if the comments are not well explained. Feel free to open an issue and ask for infos.
