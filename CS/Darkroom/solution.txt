this was a reverse engineering challenge

z3 and angr didn't work and they were my firsts attempts. 
Then I started to read carefully the code and I understood
it was a maze. I had to start from position (0, 1) and I had to
achive position (0x1e, 0x39). 
The walls were included in the binary, so I retrived them as a hex list
and I manage to rebuild the maze as a list of tuples. 
Then, with the help of chatgpt, I resolved the maze pattern. 
In addition, I have plot the maze in the walls.py, if you want to take a look. 

The x.py prints the string to put in the challenge to read the flag
